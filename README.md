# biquadris
Biquadris is a two-player competitive variant of the classic puzzle game Tetris. The game features two independent 11×15 boards where players take turns dropping tetris blocks (four-cell pieces) onto their respective boards. Unlike traditional Tetris, Biquadris is turn-based rather than real-time, allowing players unlimited time to strategically position each block.

Victory is achieved when an opponent can no longer place their next block on the board, while scoring rewards both line clears and complete block elimination based on the difficulty level at which blocks were generated.

Note: A part of the documentation is provided. As per university guidelines if you do want to see the code or the UML feel free to email me.
